    Description

    In this example, we are going to estimate the weight of a gold bar. We have unbiased scales, i.e. 
    the scalesâ€™ measurements don't have a systematic error, but the measurements do include random noise. 
    
    In this example, the system is the gold bar and the system's state is the weight of the gold bar. 
    The system's dynamic model is constant, since we assume that the weight doesn't change over short periods of time.
